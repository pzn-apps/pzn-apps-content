# Adding a Team Member

Due to Airtable's limitations there are several manual actions required to add a new User/Team Member to the Task Base. This process will take 6 simple steps and doesn't require any specific Airtable or coding skills.

#### 1. Add a team member
- From the **Task Interface** go to Users page, enter the user's name and email (optional)
- Set **Admin** checkbox if this User is an admin
	- It's not recommended to have more than one admin in the base
	- The Admin setting affects only the [[pzn-apps/en/task-base/User Manual/2. Planning|Planning]] pages of the Task Base Interface. If you don't need the Planning functionality, then you don't need Admin User.

#### 2. Setup the automation for the user's page
- Go to the base's automations
- Locate the automation named **New Task: Quick Create 1**
- Right click on it and select **Duplicate automation**
- Rename new automation if needed

- Rename the new page to the new user's name
