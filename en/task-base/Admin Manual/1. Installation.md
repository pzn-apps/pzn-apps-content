#### 1. Copy the base to your Airtable Workspace
[Get the Custom Task Manager template on Airtable Universe](https://www.airtable.com/universe/expq7at18S9rwCsbT/custom-task-manager)

#### 2. Open the copied Task Base and go to Automations sections

#### 3. Activate all Automations
Unfortunately they are disabled by default when copying a base in Airtable. It's a bit tedious, but we can't do anything about it as it's an Airtable's limitation.
